To set up the repository
Clone it to your local computer and then run ```npm i```.
Rename the .env.example file to .env.
Then run the ```node seeder -i``` to seed some sample data into the DB.
Navigate to localhost:5000/hrs and localhost:5000/students and everything should hopefully work.
If it doesn't, text me.
